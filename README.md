## User's story
This app is an informational website with rare wines. 
It has rare, and high-end wines that users might not have seen, or heard. 
Users can come to get informaton about not only the wine's general info, also if that rare wine is auctionable or not.
Targeted consumers can be Michelin restaurants, individuals like sommelier, people directly offer / bid on auction, etc. <br/>

### Types of information the app has
- Number 
- Wine's name
- Wine's image
- Wine's age (year)
- Wine's price
- its vineyard location
- wine type: RED || WHITE ||ROSÃ‰
- Auctionable
- Its tasting note

## technologies used
express, ejs, mongoose, partials, flexbox, javascipt

## unsolved problems
Even though it was a strech goal (not mendatory), I needed Login Authentication to work for my website to make it
more likely to a real website. Unlike my portfolio website (portfolio websites usually don't need login auth.), other platforms 
always have login authentification as a basic feature. I wished we'd go over that in class thoroughly.

## notes / final commment
Started with building a very simple wine collection CRUD app.
With search bar feature and login authentification it could be used as a personal purpose as well (only users can access / edit / delete && and the author can add more wine data to show new contents to visitors).
Hopefully there'd be a time that the instructors walk through login authentification in class.
